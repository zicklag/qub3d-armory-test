# voxel-armory-test

A rudimentary test or using Armory3D and voxel triangulation like a sandbox game. There is a playble web build [here](https://zicklag.github.io/voxel-armory-test/).

Left click to break blocks, right click to place blocks, click and drag to look around, use W, A, S, D, Q, and E keys to fly around.

There is a bug that occurs somewhat randomly when attempting to place blocks. It looks like it has something to do with the voxel triangulation library and there is an open issue [here](https://github.com/sh-dave/kex-vox-kha/issues/1). Big thanks to [@sh-dave](https://github.com/sh-dave) for the library. :smiley:

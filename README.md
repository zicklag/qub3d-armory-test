# voxel-armory-test

A rudimentary test or using Armory3D and voxel triangulation like a sandbox game.

Left click to break blocks, right click to place blocks, click and drag to look around, use W, A, S, D, Q, and E keys to fly around.

There is a bug that occurs somewhat randomly when attempting to place blocks. It looks like it has something to do with the voxel triangulation library and there is an open issue [here](https://github.com/sh-dave/kex-vox-kha/issues/1).
